DeepLake Vector Store[ÔÉÅ](#deeplake-vector-store "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================================

If you‚Äôre opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.


```
!pip install llama-index
```

```
import osimport textwrapfrom llama\_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, Documentfrom llama\_index.vector\_stores import DeepLakeVectorStoreos.environ["OPENAI\_API\_KEY"] = "sk-\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*"os.environ["ACTIVELOOP\_TOKEN"] = "\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*"

```
!pip install deeplake
```
if you don‚Äôt export token in your environment alternativalay you can use deeplake CLI to loging to deeplake

  The author learned that working on things that are not prestigious can be a good thing, as it canlead to discovering something real and avoiding the wrong track. The author also learned thatignorance can be beneficial, as it can lead to discovering something new and unexpected. The authoralso learned the importance of working hard, even at the parts of the job they don't like, in orderto set an example for others. The author also learned the value of unsolicited advice, as it can bebeneficial in unexpected ways, such as when Robert Morris suggested that the author should make sureY Combinator wasn't the last cool thing they did.

 A hard moment for the author was when he was dealing with urgent problems during YC and about 60%of them had to do with Hacker News, a news aggregator he had created. He was overwhelmed by theamount of work he had to do to keep Hacker News running, and it was taking away from his ability tofocus on other projects. He was also haunted by the idea that his own work ethic set the upper boundfor how hard everyone else worked, so he felt he had to work very hard. He was also dealing withdisputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to them, and fighting with peoplewho maltreated the startups. On top of this, he was given unsolicited advice from Robert Morris tomake sure Y Combinator wasn't the last cool thing he did, which made him consider quitting.
