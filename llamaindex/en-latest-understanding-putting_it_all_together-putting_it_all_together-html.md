Putting It All Together[](#putting-it-all-together "Permalink to this heading")
================================================================================

Congratulations! You’ve loaded your data, indexed it, stored your index, and queried your index. Now you’ve got to ship something to production. We can show you how to do that!

* In [Q&A Patterns](q_and_a.html) we’ll go into some of the more advanced and subtle ways you can build a query engine beyond the basics.


	+ The [terms definition tutorial](q_and_a/terms_definitions_tutorial.html) is a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on creating a subtle query application including defining your prompts and supporting images as input.
	+ We have a guide to [creating a unified query framework over your indexes](q_and_a/unified_query.html) which shows you how to run queries across multiple indexes.
	+ We talk about how to build queries over [knowledge graphs](graphs.html)
	+ And also over [structured data like SQL](structured_data.html)
* We have a guide on [how to build a chatbot](chatbots/building_a_chatbot.html)
* We talk about [building agents in LlamaIndex](agents.html)
* And last but not least we show you how to build [a full stack web application](apps.html) using LlamaIndex
