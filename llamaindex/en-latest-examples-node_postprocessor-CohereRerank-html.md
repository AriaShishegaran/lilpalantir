Final Response: Sam Altman agreed to become the president of YCombinator in October 2013. He took over starting with the winter 2014batch, and worked with the founders to help them get through Demo Dayin March 2014. He then reorganised Y Combinator to be controlled bysomeone other than the founders, so that it could last for a longtime.______________________________________________________________________Source Node 1/2Document ID: c1baaa76-acba-453b-a8d1-fdffbde1f424Similarity: 0.845305Text: day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicitedadvice.
