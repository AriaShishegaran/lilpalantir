Extracting Metadata for Better Document Indexing and Understanding[ÔÉÅ](#extracting-metadata-for-better-document-indexing-and-understanding "Permalink to this heading")
======================================================================================================================================================================

In many cases, especially with long documents, a chunk of text may lack the context necessary to disambiguate the chunk from other similar chunks of text. One method of addressing this is manually labelling each chunk in our dataset or knowledge base. However, this can be labour intensive and time consuming for a large number or continually updated set of documents.

To combat this, we use LLMs to extract certain contextual information relevant to the document to better help the retrieval and language models disambiguate similar-looking passages.

We do this through our brand-new `MetadataExtractor` modules.

If you‚Äôre opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.


```
!pip install llama-index
```

```
import nest\_asyncionest\_asyncio.apply()import osimport openaios.environ["OPENAI\_API\_KEY"] = "YOUR\_API\_KEY\_HERE"openai.api\_key = os.environ["OPENAI\_API\_KEY"]
```

```
from llama\_index import ServiceContextfrom llama\_index.llms import OpenAIfrom llama\_index.schema import MetadataMode
```

```
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.1, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", max\_tokens=512)
```
We create a node parser that extracts the document title and hypothetical question embeddings relevant to the document chunk.

We also show how to instantiate the `SummaryExtractor` and `KeywordExtractor`, as well as how to create your own custom extractorbased on the `MetadataFeatureExtractor` base class


```
from llama\_index.node\_parser import SimpleNodeParserfrom llama\_index.node\_parser.extractors import (    MetadataExtractor,    SummaryExtractor,    QuestionsAnsweredExtractor,    TitleExtractor,    KeywordExtractor,    EntityExtractor,    MetadataFeatureExtractor,)from llama\_index.text\_splitter import TokenTextSplittertext\_splitter = TokenTextSplitter(    separator=" ", chunk\_size=512, chunk\_overlap=128)class CustomExtractor(MetadataFeatureExtractor):    def extract(self, nodes):        metadata\_list = [            {                "custom": (                    node.metadata["document\_title"]                    + "\n"                    + node.metadata["excerpt\_keywords"]                )            }            for node in nodes        ]        return metadata\_listmetadata\_extractor = MetadataExtractor(    extractors=[        TitleExtractor(nodes=5, llm=llm),        QuestionsAnsweredExtractor(questions=3, llm=llm),        # EntityExtractor(prediction\_threshold=0.5),        # SummaryExtractor(summaries=["prev", "self"], llm=llm),        # KeywordExtractor(keywords=10, llm=llm),        # CustomExtractor()    ],)node\_parser = SimpleNodeParser.from\_defaults(    text\_splitter=text\_splitter,    metadata\_extractor=metadata\_extractor,)

We first load the 10k annual SEC report for Uber and Lyft for the years 2019 and 2020 respectively.

Since we are asking fairly sophisticated questions, we utilize a subquestion query engine for all QnA pipelines below, and prompt it to pay more attention to the relevance of the retrieved sources.

"""    + DEFAULT\_SUB\_QUESTION\_PROMPT\_TMPL,)

**RESULT**: As we can see, the QnA agent does not seem to know where to look for the right documents. As a result it gets the Lyft and Uber data completely mixed up.

**RESULT**: As we can see, the LLM answers the questions correctly.

### Challenges Identified in the Problem Domain[ÔÉÅ](#challenges-identified-in-the-problem-domain "Permalink to this heading")

In this example, we observed that the search quality as provided by vector embeddings was rather poor. This was likely due to highly dense financial documents that were likely not representative of the training set for the model.

In order to improve the search quality, other methods of neural search that employ more keyword-based approaches may help, such as ColBERTv2/PLAID. In particular, this would help in matching on particular keywords to identify high-relevance chunks.

Other valid steps may include utilizing models that are fine-tuned on financial datasets such as Bloomberg GPT.

Finally, we can help to further enrich the metadata by providing more contextual information regarding the surrounding context that the chunk is located in.

### Improvements to this Example[ÔÉÅ](#improvements-to-this-example "Permalink to this heading")

Generally, this example can be improved further with more rigorous evaluation of both the metadata extraction accuracy, and the accuracy and recall of the QnA pipeline. Further, incorporating a larger set of documents as well as the full length documents, which may provide more confounding passages that are difficult to disambiguate, could further stresss test the system we have built and suggest further improvements.
