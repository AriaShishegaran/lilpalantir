Automated Metadata Extraction for Better Retrieval + Synthesis[ÔÉÅ](#automated-metadata-extraction-for-better-retrieval-synthesis "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================================================================================================================

In this tutorial, we show you how to perform automated metadata extraction for better retrieval results.We use two extractors: a QuestionAnsweredExtractor which generates question/answer pairs from a piece of text, and also a SummaryExtractor which extracts summaries, not only within the current text, but also within adjacent texts.

We show that this allows for ‚Äúchunk dreaming‚Äù - each individual chunk can have more ‚Äúholistic‚Äù details, leading to higher answer quality given retrieved results.

Our data source is taken from Eugene Yan‚Äôs popular article on LLM Patterns: https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/

Setup[ÔÉÅ](#setup "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.


```
!pip install llama-index
```

```
import nest\_asyncionest\_asyncio.apply()import osimport openai
```

```
# OPTIONAL: setup W&B callback handling for tracingfrom llama\_index import set\_global\_handlerset\_global\_handler("wandb", run\_args={"project": "llamaindex"})
```

```
os.environ["OPENAI\_API\_KEY"] = "YOUR\_API\_KEY\_HERE"openai.api\_key = os.environ["OPENAI\_API\_KEY"]
```
Define Metadata Extractors[ÔÉÅ](#define-metadata-extractors "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we define metadata extractors. We define two variants:

* metadata\_extractor\_1 only contains the QuestionsAnsweredExtractor
* metadata\_extractor\_2 contains both the QuestionsAnsweredExtractor as well as the SummaryExtractor


```
from llama\_index import ServiceContextfrom llama\_index.llms import OpenAIfrom llama\_index.schema import MetadataMode
```

```
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.1, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", max\_tokens=512)
```
We also show how to instantiate the `SummaryExtractor` and `QuestionsAnsweredExtractor`.


```
from llama\_index.node\_parser import SimpleNodeParserfrom llama\_index.node\_parser.extractors import (    MetadataExtractor,    SummaryExtractor,    QuestionsAnsweredExtractor,)from llama\_index.text\_splitter import TokenTextSplittertext\_splitter = TokenTextSplitter(    separator=" ", chunk\_size=256, chunk\_overlap=128)metadata\_extractor\_1 = MetadataExtractor(    extractors=[        QuestionsAnsweredExtractor(questions=3, llm=llm),    ],    in\_place=False,)metadata\_extractor = MetadataExtractor(    extractors=[        SummaryExtractor(summaries=["prev", "self", "next"], llm=llm),        QuestionsAnsweredExtractor(questions=3, llm=llm),    ],    in\_place=False,)node\_parser = SimpleNodeParser.from\_defaults(    text\_splitter=text\_splitter,    # metadata\_extractor=metadata\_extractor,)
```
Load in Data, Run Extractors[ÔÉÅ](#load-in-data-run-extractors "Permalink to this heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We load in Eugene‚Äôs essay (https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/) using our LlamaHub SimpleWebPageReader.

We then run our extractors.


```
from llama\_index import SimpleDirectoryReader
```

```
# load in blogfrom llama\_hub.web.simple\_web.base import SimpleWebPageReaderreader = SimpleWebPageReader(html\_to\_text=True)docs = reader.load\_data(urls=["https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-patterns/"])
```

```
print(docs[0].get\_content())
```

```
orig\_nodes = node\_parser.get\_nodes\_from\_documents(docs)
```

```
# take just the first 8 nodes for testingnodes = orig\_nodes[20:28]
```

```
print(nodes[3].get\_content(metadata\_mode="all"))
```

Setup RAG Query Engines, Compare Results![ÔÉÅ](#setup-rag-query-engines-compare-results "Permalink to this heading")

We setup 3 indexes/query engines on top of the three node variants.

```
### Try out some questions[ÔÉÅ](#try-out-some-questions "Permalink to this heading")

In this question, we see that the naive response `response0` only mentions BLEU and ROUGE, and lacks context about other metrics.

`response2` on the other hand has all metrics within its context.


```
# query\_str = "In the original RAG paper, can you describe the two main approaches for generation and compare them?"query\_str = (    "Can you describe metrics for evaluating text generation quality, compare"    " them, and tell me about their downsides")response0 = query\_engine0.query(query\_str)response1 = query\_engine1.query(query\_str)response2 = query\_engine2.query(query\_str)

require creativity anddiversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634).Second, these metrics often have **poor adaptability to a wider variety oftasks**. Adopting a metric proposed for one task to another is not alwaysprudent. For example, exact match metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE are a poorfit for tasks like abstractive summarization or dialogue. Since they‚Äôre basedon n-gram overlap between output and reference, they don‚Äôt make sense for adialogue task where a wide variety of responses are possible. An output canhave zero n-gram overlap with the reference but yet be a good response.Third, these metrics have **poor reproducibility**. Even for the same metric,[high variance is reported across differentstudies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12009), possibly due to variations inhuman judgment collection or metric parameter settings. Another study of[ROUGE scores](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.107/) across 2,000studies found that scores were hard

```

```
display\_response(    response2, source\_length=1000, show\_source=True, show\_source\_metadata=True)
```
In this next question, we ask about BERTScore/MoverScore.

The responses are similar. But `response2` gives slightly more detail than `response0` since it has more information about MoverScore contained in the Metadata.


```
# query\_str = "What are some reproducibility issues with the ROUGE metric? Give some details related to benchmarks and also describe other ROUGE issues. "query\_str = (    "Can you give a high-level overview of BERTScore/MoverScore + formulas if"    " available?")response0 = query\_engine0.query(query\_str)response1 = query\_engine1.query(query\_str)response2 = query\_engine2.query(query\_str)
