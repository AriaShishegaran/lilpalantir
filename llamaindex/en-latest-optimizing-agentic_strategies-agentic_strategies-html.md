Agentic strategies[ÔÉÅ](#agentic-strategies "Permalink to this heading")
======================================================================

You can build agents on top of your existing LlamaIndex RAG pipeline to empower it with automated decision capabilities.A lot of modules (routing, query transformations, and more) are already agentic in nature in that they use LLMs for decision making.

This section shows you how to deploy a full agent loop, capable of chain-of-thought and query planning, on top of existing RAG query engines as tools for more advanced decision making.
