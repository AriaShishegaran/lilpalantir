SQL Join Query Engine[ÔÉÅ](#sql-join-query-engine "Permalink to this heading")
============================================================================

In this tutorial, we show you how to use our SQLJoinQueryEngine.

This query engine allows you to combine insights from your structured tables with your unstructured data.It first decides whether to query your structured tables for insights.Once it does, it can then infer a corresponding query to the vector store in order to fetch corresponding documents.

Setup[ÔÉÅ](#setup "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.


```
!pip install llama-index
```

```
# NOTE: This is ONLY necessary in jupyter notebook.# Details: Jupyter runs an event-loop behind the scenes.# This results in nested event-loops when we start an event-loop to make async queries.# This is normally not allowed, we use nest\_asyncio to allow it for convenience.import nest\_asyncionest\_asyncio.apply()import loggingimport syslogging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))
```

```
from llama\_index import (    VectorStoreIndex,    SimpleDirectoryReader,    ServiceContext,    StorageContext,    SQLDatabase,    WikipediaReader,)
```

```

```
Create Common Objects[ÔÉÅ](#create-common-objects "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This includes a `ServiceContext` object containing abstractions such as the LLM and chunk size.This also includes a `StorageContext` object containing our vector store abstractions.


```
# # define pinecone index# import pinecone# import os# api\_key = os.environ['PINECONE\_API\_KEY']# pinecone.init(api\_key=api\_key, environment="us-west1-gcp")# # dimensions are for text-embedding-ada-002# # pinecone.create\_index("quickstart", dimension=1536, metric="euclidean", pod\_type="p1")# pinecone\_index = pinecone.Index("quickstart")
```

```
# # OPTIONAL: delete all# pinecone\_index.delete(deleteAll=True)
```

```

```
Create Database Schema + Test Data[ÔÉÅ](#create-database-schema-test-data "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we introduce a toy scenario where there are 100 tables (too big to fit into the prompt)


```
from sqlalchemy import (    create\_engine,    MetaData,    Table,    Column,    String,    Integer,    select,    column,)
```

```
engine = create\_engine("sqlite:///:memory:", future=True)metadata\_obj = MetaData()
```

```
# create city SQL tabletable\_name = "city\_stats"city\_stats\_table = Table(    table\_name,    metadata\_obj,    Column("city\_name", String(16), primary\_key=True),    Column("population", Integer),    Column("country", String(16), nullable=False),)metadata\_obj.create\_all(engine)
```

```
# print tablesmetadata\_obj.tables.keys()
```

```
dict_keys(['city_stats'])
```
We introduce some test data into the `city\_stats` table


```
from sqlalchemy import insertrows = [    {"city\_name": "Toronto", "population": 2930000, "country": "Canada"},    {"city\_name": "Tokyo", "population": 13960000, "country": "Japan"},    {"city\_name": "Berlin", "population": 3645000, "country": "Germany"},]for row in rows:    stmt = insert(city\_stats\_table).values(\*\*row)    with engine.begin() as connection:        cursor = connection.execute(stmt)
```

```
with engine.connect() as connection:    cursor = connection.exec\_driver\_sql("SELECT \* FROM city\_stats")    print(cursor.fetchall())
```

```
[('Toronto', 2930000, 'Canada'), ('Tokyo', 13960000, 'Japan'), ('Berlin', 3645000, 'Germany')]
```
Load Data[ÔÉÅ](#load-data "Permalink to this heading")

We first show how to convert a Document into a set of Nodes, and insert into a DocumentStore.
