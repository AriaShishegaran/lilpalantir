Knowledge Graph RAG Query Engine[ÔÉÅ](#knowledge-graph-rag-query-engine "Permalink to this heading")
==================================================================================================

Graph RAG[ÔÉÅ](#graph-rag "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------

Graph RAG is an Knowledge-enabled RAG approach to retrieve information from Knowledge Graph on given task. Typically, this is to build context based on entities‚Äô SubGraph related to the task.

GraphStore backed RAG vs VectorStore RAG[ÔÉÅ](#graphstore-backed-rag-vs-vectorstore-rag "Permalink to this heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we compared how Graph RAG helps in some use cases in [this tutorial](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index_structs/knowledge_graph/KnowledgeGraphIndex_vs_VectorStoreIndex_vs_CustomIndex_combined.html#id1), it‚Äôs shown Knowledge Graph as the unique format of information could mitigate several issues caused by the nature of the ‚Äúsplit and embedding‚Äù RAG approach.

Why Knowledge Graph RAG Query Engine[ÔÉÅ](#why-knowledge-graph-rag-query-engine "Permalink to this heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Llama Index, there are two scenarios we could apply Graph RAG:

* Build Knowledge Graph from documents with Llama Index, with LLM or even [local models](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G6pcR0pXvSkdMQlAK_P-IrYgo-_staxd?usp=sharing), to do this, we should go for `KnowledgeGraphIndex`.
* Leveraging existing Knowledge Graph, in this case, we should use `KnowledgeGraphRAGQueryEngine`.


> Note, the third query engine that‚Äôs related to KG in Llama Index is `NL2GraphQuery` or `Text2Cypher`, for either exiting KG or not, it could be done with `KnowledgeGraphQueryEngine`.
> 
> 

Before we start the `Knowledge Graph RAG QueryEngine` demo, let‚Äôs first get ready for basic preparation of Llama Index.

If you‚Äôre opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.


```
!pip install llama-index
```

```
Prepare for NebulaGraph[ÔÉÅ](#prepare-for-nebulagraph "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We take [NebulaGraphStore](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/index_structs/knowledge_graph/NebulaGraphKGIndexDemo.html) as an example in this demo, thus before next step to perform Graph RAG on existing KG, let‚Äôs ensure we have a running NebulaGraph with defined data schema.

This step installs the clients of NebulaGraph, and prepare contexts that defines a [NebulaGraph Graph Space](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/3.6.0/1.introduction/2.data-model/).


```

```

```

```
Then we could instiatate a `NebulaGraphStore`, in order to create a `StorageContext`‚Äôs `graph\_store` as it.


```
graph\_store = NebulaGraphStore(    space\_name=space\_name,    edge\_types=edge\_types,    rel\_prop\_names=rel\_prop\_names,    tags=tags,)storage\_context = StorageContext.from\_defaults(graph\_store=graph\_store)
```
Here, we assumed to have the same Knowledge Graph from [this turtorial](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/query_engine/knowledge_graph_query_engine.html#optional-build-the-knowledge-graph-with-llamaindex)

Perform Graph RAG Query[ÔÉÅ](#perform-graph-rag-query "Permalink to this heading")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, let‚Äôs demo how to do Graph RAG towards an existing Knowledge Graph.

All we need to do is to use `RetrieverQueryEngine` and configure the retriver of it to be `KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever`.

The `KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever` performs the following steps:

* Search related Entities of the quesion/task
* Get SubGraph of those Entities (default 2-depth) from the KG
* Build Context based on the SubGraph

Please note, the way to Search related Entities could be either Keyword extraction based or Embedding based, which is controlled by argument `retriever\_mode` of the `KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever`, and supported options are:

* ‚Äúkeyword‚Äù
* ‚Äúembedding‚Äù(not yet implemented)
* ‚Äúkeyword\_embedding‚Äù(not yet implemented)

Here is the example on how to use `RetrieverQueryEngine` and `KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever`:


```
from llama\_index.query\_engine import RetrieverQueryEnginefrom llama\_index.retrievers import KnowledgeGraphRAGRetrievergraph\_rag\_retriever = KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever(    storage\_context=storage\_context,    service\_context=service\_context,    llm=llm,    verbose=True,)query\_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine.from\_args(    graph\_rag\_retriever, service\_context=service\_context)
```
Then we can query it like:


```
response = query\_engine.query(    "Tell me about Peter Quill?",)display(Markdown(f"<b>{response}</b>"))
```

```

```
**Peter Quill is the leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy and the main protagonist of the Guardians of the Galaxy films. He was raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers, and was abducted from Earth as a child. He is half-human, half-Celestial, and has the ability to wield an energy weapon called the Infinity Stone. He is set to return to the MCU in May 2021.**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The nature of (Sub)Graph RAG and nl2graphquery are different. No one is better than the other but just when one fits more in certain type of questions. To understand more on how they differ from the other, see [this demo](https://www.siwei.io/en/demos/graph-rag/) comparing the two.

While in real world cases, we may not always know which approach works better, thus, one way to best leverage KG in RAG are fetching both retrieval results as context and letting LLM + Prompt generate answer with them all being involved.

So, optionally, we could choose to synthesise answer from two piece of retrieved context from KG:

* Graph RAG, the default retrieval method, which extracts subgraph that‚Äôs related to the key entities in the question.
* NL2GraphQuery, generate Knowledge Graph Query based on query and the Schema of the Knowledge Graph, which is by default switched off.

We could set `with\_nl2graphquery=True` to enable it like:


```
graph\_rag\_retriever\_with\_nl2graphquery = KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever(    storage\_context=storage\_context,    service\_context=service\_context,    llm=llm,    verbose=True,    with\_nl2graphquery=True,)query\_engine\_with\_nl2graphquery = RetrieverQueryEngine.from\_args(    graph\_rag\_retriever\_with\_nl2graphquery, service\_context=service\_context)
```

```
response = query\_engine\_with\_nl2graphquery.query(    "What do you know about Peter Quill?",)display(Markdown(f"<b>{response}</b>"))
```

```

* **text2Cypher**, it generates a Cypher Query towards the answer as the context.


```
Graph Store Query: MATCH (e:`entity`)-[r:`relationship`]->(e2:`entity`)WHERE e.`entity`.`name` == 'Peter Quill'RETURN e2.`entity`.`name`
```
* **SubGraph RAG**, it get the SubGraph of ‚ÄòPeter Quill‚Äô to build the context.
